# Chatbot Using LLM Model

## Description
This project implements a chatbot application powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries, providing intelligent and context-aware conversations. It leverages the power of advanced language models to simulate natural human-like dialogues.

## Features
- **Interactive Conversation**: Chatbot responds to user input in real time with intelligent, relevant answers.
- **Customizable Responses**: The bot can be configured to answer specific queries based on predefined contexts.
- **Advanced NLP Integration**: Uses state-of-the-art NLP techniques to understand and generate human-like responses.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Language Model**: [Ollama LLM](https://ollama.com) (or any other LLM model of your choice).
- **Backend**: Python, Node.js (or any suitable backend language).
- **Frontend**: React (or any framework of your choice).
- **NLP Libraries**: HuggingFace Transformers, SpaCy, etc.
